1. The event is triggered by clicking the mouse on any tile on the board as long as the "kill count" is at a value of 5 or higher.
   The kill count is incremented anytime the player kills any alien entity on the board and is decremented by 5 any time
   the event is triggered.

2. When the event is triggered, 3 things will happen. First, a friendly master chief spawns on the tile that is clicked
   and will try to assist you in killing the aliens using AStar. However, he can only kill the blue elites (elite) and the small grunts.
   He cannot kill the red elites (elite2). Simultaneously, once a tile is clicked, if there are any blue elites on the board,
   the nearest one will be turned into a red elite. Lastly and also simultaneously, the tiles of the 4 cardinal neighbors will
   be turned into broken tiles.

3. The red elite is the new entity that is created. It's first objective is to kill the nearest friendly master chief
   to its location as long as there are friendly master chiefs on the board. Once there are no master chiefs left
   besides the player, the red elites will then target the washing machines in order to try and end the game. The red
   elite uses AStar for both of these tasks. The nearest blue entity that is turned into a red entity will cease to exist
   and be removed from the entities list.

4. The friendly master chief that is spawned will act just as all the other ones do.

5. Masato - Coded the changes to the background tiles and the spawning of the new friendly master chief
    Jason - Coded the red elite (elite2) class and changing the nearest blue elite (if one exists) to a red elite
