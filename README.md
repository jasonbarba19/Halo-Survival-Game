# Halo-Survival-Game
Halo-themed Survival Slider Game
This is a survival game where the player must use the arrow keys to move and fend off enemy aliens in order to stop them from destroying
the player's washing machines! The game has a running score, so the longer the player keeps at least one of their machines from being 
destroyed, the better they will score. The player can click on an open square on the map every 5 kills that they accumulate in order
to spawn a friendly CPU who will assist them in the fight for survival. However, be careful not to spawn a friendly close to a blue alien,
as it will cause it to turn into a red alien which is a much more lethal creature! Good luck!
